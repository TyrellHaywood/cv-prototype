# cv-prototype

## Description

This prototype is an assistive navigation app designed to help visually impaired users navigate their environment more confidently, and in future a way to collaborate digitally with others. Using computer vision, audio / haptic feedback, and augmented reality, the project aims to provide real-time spatial awareness and guidance. Currently in its early prototyping stage, the app will use technologies like object detection and edge recognition to help users understand their surroundings, with a vision of creating a more accessible and supportive navigation experience.
